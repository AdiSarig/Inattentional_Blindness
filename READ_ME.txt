About:
In this experiment participants are presented with 3 different types of stimuli - faces, houses and noise, as well as distractors - four cut in half circles colored half red half green.
There are three phases in the experiment followed by questions on the presented stimuli.
In the first and second phase participants are asked to respond regarding the orientation of the discs (whether they are all at the same orientation or one is at a different orientation).
In the third phase they are asked to respond regarding the stimuli - whether they saw a face, a house or neither.

How to run:
Running the experiment is through the Main function within the Code folder.
This function calls the rest of the experiment and later saves the behavioral data in the data folder.
