# Inattentional Blindness

# Participants

A total of xx healthy volunteers will be included in the experiment. Participants will be excluded in the following cases: (a) report not perceiving any faces/houses in phase two; (b) not having enough trials (n=80) in each experimental cell due to excessive artifacts or eye movements; or (c) showing no N170 in phase three. Participants will be recruited if they report normal or corrected-to-normal vision and no history of neurological conditions. They will provide informed consent prior to participating and will participate for either course credit or payment.

# Stimuli

All stimuli will be presented on a 1920 x 1080 TFT LCD VPIXX display monitor with a refresh rate of 120 Hz using Matlab’s Psychtoolbox 3.0. They include four circular discs of approx. 3° visual angle, positioned in each corner of the display. Each circle is bisected such that half is colored red and half is colored green. All four discs will either be identically oriented such that they will all be bisected vertically or horizontally, with red and green oriented in the same direction, or one of the discs will be selected at random to rotate by 90 degrees such that its bisection opposed the other discs. (see Figure 1). In addition, three types of stimuli will be presented: faces, houses, and control noise patterns (see Figure 1). The face and house stimuli will be 24 simple line drawings used by Schurger et al. (2015), presented on top of a noise background, generated by phase scrambling the stimuli and overlaying them on top of each other at Michelson contrast of 0.4. The noise-only stimuli will constitute only the noise background, without the additional drawing on them. Finally, additional line drawings of objects and animals will be used as invalid stimuli for the post-experiment questionnaire.

Figure 1. Experimental procedures. Face/Hose/Noise stimuli are presented centrally at fixation, together with four red/green disks presented at four corners of the display. In the example here, the top right disc has rotated in the face trial, and the top left disc is rotated in the control trial. In both cases, a right arrow button response is required (in phase one and two). Comparatively, in the house trial, no discs were rotated, therefore requiring a left arrow button response (button assignment counterbalanced between subjects). Stimuli here are for illustration purposes and are not to scale.



# Procedure

The experiment consisted of three phases involving two separate tasks: a disc orientation detection task in phases one and two, and an object category discrimination task in phase three. This shift in task enabled the critical manipulation of task relevance: the face/house/noise stimuli were task relevant in phase three but remained entirely task-irrelevant in phases one and two. For the orientation detection task, participants will be asked to respond with a left arrow button response if all circles were similarly oriented and a right arrow button response if any of the circles are oriented differently than the others (button assignment counterbalanced between subjects). For the object category discrimination task, participants will be instructed to ignore the discs and respond whether a face (left arrow button), a house (right arrow button; face/house buttons counterbalanced), or a control stimulus (down arrow button) was presented. 
Each phase will include five blocks of 72 trials (24 faces, 24 houses, 24 noise stimuli, so that each stimulus is repeated twice within a block). Participants will be given self-paced rest breaks after every block. Blocks will always begin with three trials of noise stimuli, followed by psaudo randomly sequenced faces, houses and noise stimuli. with the faces and houses stimuli interspersed between noise trials such that they Each had an equal 33.33% chance of appearing in any given block with no more than three consecutive trials of the same type. This is meant to create a “jitter” between stimulus trials to minimize participants’ capacity to anticipate up-and-coming face/house trials. 
In all phases, trials were identical: a 100 milliseconds stimulus (face/house/noise, and the four discs) was followed by a 1300 to 1500 millisecond fixation dot presentation, serving as the response window (duration randomly determined per trial). Then, participants will respond according to the task in that phase. 


Prior to the experiment, participants will be provided examples of what to look for in the orientation detection task. Participants will then run through one practice block, during which no faces/houses are presented. Following both phases one and two, participants will be provided a questionnaire in which they will be asked to detail whether they had noticed anything unexpected during the experiment. The questionnaire is based on Shafto and Pitts (2015) and serves to both determine whether participants had spontaneously noticed the stimuli and to cue participants that these will appear in between the discs in subsequent phases of the experiment. For example, the questionnaire included several open-ended items that explicitly cued participants to anticipate the presentation of faces and houses, such as “If you saw faces/houses, did you notice anything special about them?”. The questionnaire will present participants with example items that include both valid (e.g., faces/houses) and invalid stimuli (e.g., objects/animals). Using a five-point scale, participants will rate both their confidence (1. very confident I did not see it, 2. confident I did not see it, 3. uncertain, 4. confident I saw it, 5. very confident I saw it) and frequency (1. never, 2. rarely, e.g. less than 10 times, 3. infrequently, e.g. 10-50 times, 4. frequently, e.g. 50-100 times, 5. very frequently, e.g. over 100 times) in having seen the item. Participants will be notified that these stimuli are mere examples of the stimulus categories, and are to provide their ratings regardless of whether the items constituted what they may or may not have noticed. Participants will be considered inattentionally blind if they rate their confidence in seeing faces/houses as a three or less, and if they otherwise provide no evidence of noticing these stimuli.

# Post phase questionnaire:

Some participants were randomly assigned to a condition in which items other than the circles and random noise appeared on the screen. Did you notice anything other than the circles and random noise while you were completing the task? If so, please describe
below. Be as detailed as possible. If not, please indicate that.

If you did notice items other than the circles and the noise, at what point in the phase did you notice them?
___________________________________________________________


Please indicate, regarding the items displayed on the screen, how confident you are in having seen each item, and how frequently you saw them. Use the scales provided below.


How confident are you that you saw the following items?

1 = very confident I did not see it

2 = confident I did not see it

3 = uncertain

4 = confident I saw it

5 = very confident I saw it

___________________________________________________________

How frequently did you see each of the following items?

1 = never

2 = rarely (less than 10 times)

3 = infrequently (10-50 times)

4 = frequently (50-100 times)

5 = very frequently (over 100 times)
